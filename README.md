## üöÄ How to Run This Dashboard

### Option 1: Quick Start with Create React App (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version 18+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

#### Steps

1. **Create a new React app:**
```bash
npx create-react-app device-dashboard
cd device-dashboard
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install papaparse recharts lucide-react
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

3. **Configure Tailwind CSS:**

Create `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Create `postcss.config.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

4. **Update `src/index.css`:**
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}
```

5. **Replace `src/App.js`** with the dashboard component code from the artifact

6. **Run the application:**
```bash
npm start
```

The dashboard will open at `http://localhost:3000`

---

### Option 2: Standalone HTML File

For quick testing without a full React setup:

1. Create an `index.html` file
2. Include CDN links for React, Tailwind, PapaParse, Recharts, and Lucide
3. Paste the component code in a `<script type="text/babel">` tag
4. Open the file in a web browser

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This method is for testing only, not recommended for production.

## üìà Dashboard Metrics Explained

### Summary Cards

| Metric | Description | Data Source |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Total Devices** | Unique devices across all platforms | All platforms combined |
| **Unprotected** | Devices without Crowdstrike | Azure/Intune devices missing from Crowdstrike |
| **Non-Compliant** | Devices failing compliance checks | Azure AD `isCompliant`, Intune `Compliance` |
| **High Risk** | Devices with risk score ‚â•50 | Calculated from all factors |
| **Seen within 45 days** | Recently active devices | Last Seen/Last Check-in/Last Sign-in/Last Logon |
| **Stale 90+ days** | Not seen in 90+ days | Last Seen/Last Check-in/Last Sign-in/Last Logon |
| **Unencrypted** | Devices without disk encryption | Intune `Encrypted` field |
| **Unassigned** | Devices with no user | User fields across all platforms |

### OS-Specific Drill-Downs üÜï

The dashboard provides detailed breakdowns for each major operating system:

#### Windows Devices
- **Total Windows systems** - All devices running Windows OS
- **% of Total Devices** - Percentage of fleet that is Windows
- **Active within 45 days** - Recently active Windows devices
- **% Active** - What percentage of Windows devices are active

#### macOS Devices
- **Total macOS systems** - All Apple Mac computers
- **% of Total Devices** - Percentage of fleet that is macOS
- **Active within 45 days** - Recently active Macs
- **% Active** - What percentage of Macs are active

#### iOS Devices
- **Total iOS devices** - All iPhones and iPads
- **% of Total Devices** - Percentage of fleet that is iOS
- **Active within 45 days** - Recently active iOS devices
- **% Active** - What percentage of iOS devices are active

#### Android Devices
- **Total Android devices** - All Android phones and tablets
- **% of Total Devices** - Percentage of fleet that is Android

### Disabled Devices Tracking üÜï

Monitor devices that have been administratively disabled:

| Metric | Description | Color |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Total Disabled** | All devices disabled in Azure AD or AD | Red |
| **Active within 45 days** | Recently disabled devices (were active <45 days ago) | Green |
| **Disabled in Azure AD** | Devices with `accountEnabled = false` | Orange |
| **Disabled in Active Directory** | Devices with `Enabled = false` | Yellow |

**Why this matters:** Disabled devices that were recently active may need to be removed from other systems (Crowdstrike, Intune) to avoid licensing costs and security gaps.

### Risk Score Calculation

Risk scores range from **0-100** with points added for:
- **+30 points** - Missing Crowdstrike protection
- **+25 points** - Detections disabled in Crowdstrike
- **+20 points** - Non-compliant in Azure/Intune
- **+15 points** - Unencrypted (Intune)
- **+10 points** - Stale >90 days

**Color Coding:**
- üü¢ **Green (0-14)** - Low risk
- üü° **Yellow (15-29)** - Medium risk
- üü† **Orange (30-49)** - Elevated risk
- üî¥ **Red (50+)** - High risk

### Department Statistics

Shows per-department metrics with **toggleable column information**:
- **Total** - Number of devices
- **Protected** - Devices with Crowdstrike
- **Protection %** - Percentage with AV (color-coded)
- **Compliant** - Devices meeting policies
- **Compliance %** - Compliance rate (color-coded)
- **Encrypted** - Devices with encryption
- **Stale** - Devices >30 days inactive
- **High Risk** - Devices with risk ‚â•50

**New:** Click the üëÅÔ∏è icon to show/hide detailed column definitions.

### Source Indicators

Colored dots in the device table show platform presence:
- üîµ **Blue** - Crowdstrike
- üü¢ **Green** - Azure AD
- üü£ **Purple** - Intune
- üü† **Orange** - Freshdesk
- üî∑ **Teal** - Active Directory

Multiple dots = device exists in multiple systems

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No data showing"
- Ensure all 5 CSV files are uploaded
- Check that CSV headers match expected column names exactly
- Verify CSV files contain data rows

### "Device counts seem wrong"
- Dashboard matches devices by hostname (case-insensitive)
- Active Directory uses the `Name` column (not DNSHostName)
- Devices with different hostnames across platforms won't match
- Check for hostname inconsistencies in source systems

### "OS drill-downs showing 0 devices"
- Verify OS fields are populated in CSVs (Platform, operatingSystem)
- Check that OS names include keywords: "Windows", "Mac", "iOS", "Android"
- iOS detection looks for "iOS", "iPhone", or "iPad"
- Android detection looks for "Android"

### "Disabled devices count is 0"
- Check Azure AD CSV has `accountEnabled` column
- Check Active Directory CSV has `Enabled` column
- Values should be boolean (True/False) or strings ('True'/'False')
- Dashboard checks for: false, 'false', 'False'

### "Column info not visible in dark mode" ‚úÖ FIXED
- Toggle should now work properly in dark mode
- Background adapts: blue-50 (light) or blue-900/30 (dark)
- If still having issues, try refreshing the page

### "Risk scores seem high/low"
- Risk calculation is automatic based on security factors
- Review individual device details to see contributing factors
- Scores reflect cumulative security gaps

### "Department stats showing 'Unassigned'"
- Department field only comes from Freshdesk
- Ensure Freshdesk CSV has `Department` column populated
- Devices not in Freshdesk will show as "Unassigned"

### "Active Directory devices not showing"
- Verify the CSV has a `Name` column (required)
- Check that computer names match hostnames in other systems
- AD data shows as teal dots in the Sources column
- Review Platform Coverage chart to see AD device count

### "Pie chart labels overlapping" ‚úÖ FIXED
- OS Distribution chart now uses legend instead of inline labels
- Hover over segments to see details
- Legend appears below the chart

### "Logo not loading"
- Fallback text "VOA" will display if logo fails
- Check internet connection (logo loads from external URL)
- Dashboard functions normally without logo
